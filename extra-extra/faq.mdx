<Accordion title="How does Clay work?">
There are 3 simple steps to using Clay ([How Clay Works](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MhUw3O-ZBQuPqc-T9cn/s/jKNPMVHMFkeY74YGvCvv/start-here/using-clay/how-clay-works)): 

* **Find leads:** Clay makes it easy to pull in lists of leads from dozens of sources including LinkedIn, Github, HubSpot/Salesforce, CSV imports, or even Webhooks.

* **Enrich leads:** Clay has built-in partnerships with some of the most powerful enrichment providers. Whether you’re starting with names, emails, LinkedIn addresses, or even just a company domain, Clay’s integrations can return almost any people or company data possible from a number of open roles to years of experience to validated work emails.

* **Connect destinations:** Clay connects with hundreds of different tools to fit perfectly within your stack including Outreach, [customer.io](http://customer.io/), HubSpot/Salesforce, Apollo, Zapier (HTTP API), and much more.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is Clay able to offer so many integrations at a low cost?">
We offer a simple monthly subscription at a fraction of the cost of most single data providers. This is because we buy our credits in bulk, so you can get them for much cheaper without signing onto large, unnecessary commitments. You can pick and choose the best tools for your prospecting flow, and even bring your own if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does Clay's Chrome Extension work? Is it included in my plan?">
  Yes. [Clay’s Chrome Extension](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MhUw3O-ZBQuPqc-T9cn/s/jKNPMVHMFkeY74YGvCvv/extra-extra/chrome-extension) makes it easy to scrape and import data from any website in a few simple clicks. For example, you can scrape lists from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, BuiltWith, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ycombinator.com, and much more. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is Clay different than Clearbit, People Data Labs, or other data providers?">
  Unlike Clearbit, People Data Labs, and other enrichment services, we are not a data provider. We connect with 50+ data providers into a simple prospecting tool so you can build workflow automation, build enrichments on top of each other, score leads, and export data into your CRM or email sequencer.

Clay makes it possible to do wicked multi-enrichments such as using Google API to find a LinkedIn profile, then using a LinkedIn provider to pull in their profile information, and then using the chatGPT to infer information or personalize at scale.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are enrichment API keys included? Can I use my own API key?">
  Yes! Enrichment API keys are built into the product so you don't need to purchase your own (expensive) plan with each provider. That said, certain integrations will require your own API key like Apollo and a few others. You're also welcome to connect your own API key so that you can prioritize spending your Clay credits included in your plan on specific enrichments.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I run enrichments on a schedule/timer?">
  Not yet! We're working on this to make it possible.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do credits work? Do they roll over to next month?">

Each plan offers you a bucket of credits that you'll have access to on a monthly basis; they don't roll over so we recommend you enrich as many leads as possible with the data you need for your campaigns.

If you're using Clay's API account to run an enrichment, the cost is based on how much each individual data provider charges Clay to run it and that is reflected as Clay credits, and that's why you'll see variable credit costs.

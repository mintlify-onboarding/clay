### Getting started with Sources

**Sources let you pull live data into Clay.** There are three main types of sources: webhooks, direct integrations, and CSV imports.

**** **Webhook** **:** Clay's webhook source allows you to stream any data into your table by simply sending events to an endpoint, for example, website signups, Zapier integrations, Typeform responses.

**Direct integrations:** Clay's library of source integrations allows you to pull directly from your tooling with a simple OAuth, for example querying data from Linkedin, or streaming in contacts from your HubSpot:

* **** **LinkedIn** **:** Query thousands of leads directly into your table through LinkedIn. Search profiles based on title, industry, experience, location, and much more.

* **** **Github Stargazers** **:** Find new leads and prospects by pulling stargazers of any Github Repository directly into your table.

### 1️⃣ What are conditional formulas?

You may only want to run an enrichment if a certain condition is true. For example:

* Only run an email enrichment column, if their title contains "VP"

* Only run a headcount growth enrichment if the company size is over 100 people

* Only run an AI column if a news article was found

Conditional formulas are a powerful way you can do any of these (and more!) within Clay. 

The best part? You don't need to know any coding language to create these formulas! Our AI formula generator turns your every request into a formula:)

### 2️⃣ How can you use them?

Luckily it's quite easy:) 

1. 1.  
Just scroll down to "Run Settings" on any enrichment column:

1. 2.  
Type out what you'd like to do inside the prompt box. Type "/" to enter a column you'd like the condition to run off. For example - If you only want the enrichment to run if the headcount is greater than 40, type out "Only run if /headcount is greater than 40".

2. 3.  
Click "Generate Formula" - we'll use AI to turn your request into a formula.

3. 4.  
Check the sample output, and save the formula!

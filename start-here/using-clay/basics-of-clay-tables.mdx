### Hiding Columns

Quickly hide or un-hide columns to clean up your table. If you have multiple people working on a table, and you only want people to see specific columns, this is a great way to manage what people see.

Click on the eye emoji to see all columns in your table. 

* Toggle the columns on or off individually.

* Or click the "Show all" or "Hide all" to quickly adjust the entire table.

### Re-ordering Columns

Re-order your columns to clean up your workflow and make the order more clear. We typically recommend you order your workflow sequentially from left to right. This way it's easier to quickly understand the order of actions in your table.

There are two ways to re-order columns.

1. 1.  
Click the eye emoji to access the column view. This is the same place where you can hide/un-hide columns. Simply drag the column you want up or down. This is the fastest way to re-arrange the column order.

1. 2.  
Click on the column in your table and move it left or right.

### Filters

Easily filter down your table based on any of your columns. We offer different filters based on the column type. Here's the most important ones

If your column is a number type:

* Equal to, not equal to, greater than, greater or equal to, less than, less or equal to, is empty, is not empty.

If your column is a text type:

* Equal to, not equal to, contains, does not contain, is empty, is not empty.

### Sort

* Sort your table based on any of the columns in your table.

* If you've chosen a text column, you can sort A -> Z or Z -> A

* If you've chosen a number column, you can sort 0 -> 9 or 9 -> 0

### Views

You can easily create different views of your table with this feature. Combining all of the features above, you can create new views with specific column orders, filters, hidden columns, and more.

Two main reasons people use views:

* To create different views of companies or people based on their quality. You can create a view for high-quality leads (based on your filters) and low-quality leads (based on different filters).

* Two turn their workflow into a process their team can easily follow.  
   * For example, let's say you had a Clay table where you want your BDR team to simply upload a list of peoples' LinkedIn profiles, and quickly get a list of their emails.  
         * You can label the first view ("Import Data Here"). Hide all columns except for the LinkedIn column so there is no confusion  
         * Create a 2nd view called ("Export Data Here"). Hide all the columns except for full name, email, and LinkedIn profile.

### Run options

There are a few different ways you can run an action column. We've created multiple ways so you can easily test actions before running them for all of your rows.

* Run first 10 columns  
   * You'll see this option when setting up an action. Click this button to only run the first 10 columns. We recommend doing this for all actions unless you're already very familiar with the platform. This will allow you to test it before spending credits on all of your rows.

* Run all rows that haven't run or have errors  
   * You'll see this option when clicking on the play button for any action column. This will essentially run the entire column. Only columns that have not yet run (or have errors) will run. This means you will not spend credits on rows that have already run.

* Run starting from a specific row  
   * Click on the column header and hover over "Run column" to see this option.  
         * It's particularly helpful if you want to bulk run a specific group of rows. First specify the number of rows you want to run. Then specify which row you want it to start on.

* Force run all x rows  
   * Click on the column header and hover over "Run column" to see this option.  
         * This will force run all rows in the column. If a column has run before, this option will re-run the row (and spend additional credits). This is particularly helpful if you've made a change to the inputs and want to ensure everything has refreshed.

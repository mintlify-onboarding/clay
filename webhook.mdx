### Step 1 - Create a source

Click `Webhook` from the homepage or by clicking the sources table. Select if you want to create a `New People Table` or `New Blank Table`, then copy the `Webhook URL`.

### Step 2 - Adding Webhook to Webflow

Go to Webhook and click `+Add Webhook`. Select `Trigger Type` and paste the `Webhook URL`, then click `Add Webhook`. Scroll up and click `Publish`, and hit `Publish to Selected Domains`.

Go to the landing page and type in an email, click `Bypass the waitlist today`.

### Step 3 - Extract data

Go back to the table and you will see a record of `New Webhook Source`. Click the expand button to extract email. Extracted email will automatically fill out some of the enrichment sources.
